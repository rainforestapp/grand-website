# Grand Website

Static landing-page wireframe for Grand.

## Status

- Added a first-pass one-page wireframe for the public landing page.
- Positioning is companion-first for the older person, with family reassurance as the buyer story.
- The wireframe uses the existing Grand product language: warm surfaces, sage/clay accents, editorial type moments, privacy by default, and no surveillance framing.
- Added an optimized hero image from the selected Pexels option: Moe Magners photo `pexels-moe-magners-5335290.jpg`, resized to 2400px wide at `assets/hero-pexels-moe-magners-5335290.jpg`.
- Deployed the static page with GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch under `rainforestapp/grand-website`; the `Deploy GitHub Pages` workflow publishes `main` to `gh-pages` automatically when `main` changes.
- Configured GitHub Pages for the canonical custom domain `www.grandeldercare.com`, with DNSimple records pointing `www` to `rainforestapp.github.io` and the apex domain to GitHub Pages A/AAAA records. GitHub is issuing a certificate for both `www.grandeldercare.com` and `grandeldercare.com`.
- Refined the landing-page copy after review feedback, including more specific music examples, clearer reminder language, and replacing the abstract product preview with concrete Grace app ideas.
- Reframed the landing page around the broader Grand system: Grace is the smart speaker companion, and optional Grand Satellites add home tracking.
- Added a "How Grand works" section that explains Grace as the smart speaker and Grand Satellites as the optional home-tracking add-on.
- Added a Grand satellites/home-tracking section focused on daily rhythm, routine changes, and filtered emergency-like alerts without cameras or live feeds.
- Split use cases into "Ask Grace" and "Grand notices" so companion moments and home-tracking moments can sit together without blurring their roles.
- Replaced the abstract satellite floor-plan with resized real Grand iOS app screenshots from `../grand-ios/docs/screenshots`: `ios-home.png` and `pr1-settings-index.png`.
- Simplified the hero headline and strapline so first-time readers understand the promise without needing prior context for Grand, Grace, or satellites.
- Rewrote the hero to lead with reassurance instead of the two-part independence/worry construction. **Why:** "You'll know she's okay." states the outcome the buyer actually wants in one breath, and the shorter strapline ("A few discreet sensors to flag when something's off — no cameras, no wearables, nothing to charge.") drops the "small hub" mechanism detail that the "How Grand works" section already covers. Also swapped the hero CTAs so "See how Grand works" is now primary (filled) and reordered ahead of the secondary "Be first to know" outline button, because an unconvinced first-time visitor needs to understand the product before committing to the waitlist. Removed the "Care at home" hero eyebrow so nothing competes with the headline, added `text-wrap: balance` on `#hero-title` so the two-line headline doesn't orphan "okay." on its own line, and raised the hero copy's bottom padding (`clamp(42px, 9vw, 140px)`) so the shorter block sits optically centered on tall desktop viewports instead of pinned to the bottom edge.
- Wired the waitlist form for a Google Sheets backend via Google Apps Script, including client-side email validation, status messaging, and browser/user-agent metadata capture.
- Repositioned the entire page from companion-first to peace-of-mind / dignity-first, aimed squarely at the adult child (the buyer). This supersedes the companion-first framing above. **Why:** the product's MVP is a quiet, passive sensor system (a hub + sensors) that lets an adult child know their parent is okay without cameras, wearables, or anything that announces "you're old" — not a voice companion. The "Grace" companion concept and all companion features (music, reading aloud, trivia, conversation, family-message dictation) were removed because they describe a different product and were not in the MVP spec.
  - "Grand satellites" renamed to "Grand sensors"; the device story is now simply "the Grand hub + Grand sensors."
  - Hero now leads with the fear→relief promise. *(The wording was later tightened to "You'll know she's okay." — see the hero rewrite below.)*
  - Added an upfront "The worry" problem section after the hero that sets up the fear and contrasts pendants/watches, call-for-help buttons, and cameras before presenting the solution. (This replaced a later "Why not a wearable, button, or camera?" comparison block, which said the same thing twice once the problem was framed up front.)
  - Trust close ties privacy directly to dignity and drops conversation-era rules; no pricing and no public mention of human-in-the-loop alert review, per product decision. *(The human-in-the-loop decision was later reversed — see the Grand Call Center section below.)*
  - Reused the existing iOS screenshots (`assets/grand-ios-home.png`, `assets/grand-ios-settings.png`) — they already show the passive-sensing view with no "Grace" UI.
- Added a "Grand Call Center" section (`#response`) between the caregiver experience and the waitlist. **Why:** this reverses the earlier "no public mention of human-in-the-loop alert review" decision — the call center is now a headline differentiator, because "what actually happens in an emergency?" is the buyer's biggest pre-purchase question and the human agent + EMS escalation is the answer. The section presents the emergency flow as a four-step process (a real person calls through the hub/sensors → confirms she's safe → calls EMS if not → the family is notified throughout and can join the call), with a call-center agent photo (`assets/call-center-pexels-kampus-8204317.jpg`, Pexels / Kampus Production, cropped 3:4 around the agent and optimized to ~250KB). The caregiver-experience intro and the urgent signal tile were reworded to hand off to this section instead of implying an automated-only reach-out, and an "Emergency response" nav link was added.
- Reformatted "The worry" section from a three-card competitor teardown into a narrative "anxiety window" timeline plus a compact "you've probably already thought about…" strikethrough list. **Why:** user research (May–June interviews) showed the problem is emotional, not comparative — the single most vivid finding was the adult child who worries from the moment she wakes until it's socially acceptable to call at 8am, and the failed alternatives land as stories (the pendant on the nightstand during the fall, the button that's "a reminder you're old") rather than spec-sheet dismissals. The old equal-cards format asked visitors to evaluate product categories before feeling understood, and gave competitor categories the same visual weight as the worry itself. The timeline dramatizes a familiar morning (clay dots for the anxious beats, a sage dot for the relief beat), a payoff line bridges into "How Grand works," and the three alternatives survive as demoted one-line dismissals so the content wasn't lost.

- Added baseline SEO and indexing plumbing: canonical URL, Open Graph and Twitter card tags, JSON-LD structured data (Organization + WebSite), `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and a favicon set. **Why:** the site previously had none of this, so Google had little to work with and link previews in iMessage/Slack/social showed no image or branding. This is intentionally the crawlability baseline, not an optimization pass. See the "SEO & Indexing" section below.

- Enriched waitlist signups to qualify fit against the ICP **without adding friction to the email capture**. **Why:** the sheet previously held only an email, giving no way to tell whether a signup matches the target buyer (an anxious adult child of a single senior who lives alone) or where to launch first. Three changes:
  - **Passive location at signup.** `script.js` fires a best-effort client-side IP geolocation lookup (`https://ipapi.co/json/`) on page load and attaches `geo` (city/region/country/postal) to the signup payload. It is time-boxed to ~1.2s and can never block or fail a signup — if it's slow or blocked, the row just has no location. This is on top of the coarse `timezone` already captured.
  - **Post-signup profile page (`welcome.html`).** The email stays the only required field; on success the homepage stores the email in `sessionStorage` (not the URL, to avoid leaking it into referrer/pixel traffic) and redirects to `welcome.html`, which asks five optional questions — full name, ZIP code, why they're interested, whether the person Grand is for lives alone, and alpha-tester interest. This is progressive profiling: motivated signers answer, hesitant ones still convert. The page is `noindex`.
  - **Real conversion events.** Both pixels previously fired only `PageView`/`PageVisit`, so ad platforms couldn't see signups. `script.js` now fires `fbq('track','Lead')` + `rdt('track','SignUp')` on signup, and `fbq('track','CompleteRegistration')` + `rdt('track','Lead')` on profile completion.
- Added **Privacy Policy (`privacy.html`)** and **Terms of Service (`terms.html`)** pages and linked both from the footer of `index.html`, `welcome.html`, and each other. **Why:** the site runs Meta and Reddit ad pixels and collects waitlist emails plus optional profile data, so it needs a published privacy policy and terms — and the ad platforms require a linked privacy policy for pixel/conversion use. Both pages are boilerplate written from what we know about Grand (pre-launch home-sensor product, waitlist only, US-based call center is not yet live), using a new shared `.legal-*` layout in `styles.css` (readable 760px prose column, serif section headings, clay links) that matches the site's warm surfaces and editorial type. The privacy policy explicitly discloses that **a waitlist sign-up is recorded as a conversion event and shared back to advertising partners (Meta, Reddit)** so campaigns can be measured — the specific fact the team wanted stated. The legal pages deliberately omit the Meta/Reddit pixel snippets (no need to fire ad tracking on the privacy/terms pages themselves) and are indexable (added to `sitemap.xml`). One placeholder to confirm with counsel: governing law is set to Delaware. All contact addresses site-wide use `hello@grandeldercare.com` — a `mailto:` typo (`grandelderare.com`, missing a "c") in the `index.html` and `welcome.html` footers was corrected as part of this change.
- Rebuilt the site footer: a top row with a "Contact us" label + `hello@grandeldercare.com` `mailto:` link on the left and the four nav links as a single right-aligned column, above a bottom bar with the `grand.` wordmark logo (`assets/grand-logo.png`) on the bottom-left and the copyright on the bottom-right (no divider — the footer reads as one section). **Why:** earlier footer iterations laid the nav links out as a run-on horizontal line, then as labelled columns that still read as cluttered. This is the simplified layout the team asked for. The "Grand is not a replacement for 911 or professional medical care" disclaimer was dropped per request, and the earlier "Quiet home monitoring…" tagline was removed from the footer (it wasn't requested). The logo is the brand wordmark trimmed and made transparent (cream background removed) so it blends on the footer surface.
- Added **"Grace" product-experiment subpages** at `/gracecompanion` and `/gracephone` as lean, de-branded scaffolds, with `/grace` now available as a clone of `/gracecompanion`. **Why:** we want to test separate product lines under the Grand umbrella without touching the main Grand page or linking the sites together. See the "Grace Product Subpages" section below. The main Grand page (`index.html`) and all its supporting files were left completely untouched.
- **Consolidated the Grace experiment to a single `/grace` page.** Deleted the `gracecompanion/` and `gracephone/` folders, leaving `/grace` as the only Grace site. **Why:** we no longer need three parallel product-line experiments — one Grace page is enough to maintain and iterate on. This supersedes the "three independent sites" model above. On the next deploy the `rsync --delete` step drops the live `/gracecompanion` and `/gracephone` URLs automatically; nothing else referenced them (no cross-nav, not in `sitemap.xml`), and the root Grand site is untouched. `/grace` keeps its existing `product = "gracecompanion"` waitlist tag so signups continue flowing to the GraceCompanion sheet tabs (data continuity; the label is invisible to users).
- **Standardized the `/grace` "What Grace does" section to list format.** Converted the two flowing-paragraph blocks ("Grace keeps her company", "She brings people closer") to the same `.does-list` bold-lead-in style as the middle block, and removed the leftover `[TK - confirm in v1]` marker. **Why:** the section mixed prose and list formatting; the founder found the scannable bold-lead-in list easier to read, so all three blocks now match. HTML-only change — `.does-list` was already defined in `grace/styles.css`.
- **Switched the Grand alpha signup from email to phone number, on its own sheet tabs.** The "Become a tester" field on `index.html` now collects a phone number (`type="tel"`, 10–15 digit validation) instead of an email, and the whole Grand site is tagged `product = "grandphone"` so signups, profile answers, and analytics events route to two **new** tabs — `Grand phone number alpha list` and `Grand phone number events` — via the existing `PRODUCT_SHEETS` mechanism. **Why:** the team wants to reach alpha testers by phone for onboarding calls, and a clean break onto new tabs keeps phone numbers out of the historical `email` column and freezes the email-era `Waitlist`/`Events` tabs as an archive. `waitlist.gs` gained a `phone` column (appended last, so existing sheets auto-migrate with a blank column) and now identifies people by phone (digits-only match) for phone products, keeping the email contract for everything else. **Deploy dependency:** the Apps Script must be redeployed (Deploy → Manage deployments → New version) for phone signups to be accepted — the currently deployed version validates email server-side and would reject them. Ship the frontend and the redeploy together.
- **Reworked the post-submit screen on `welcome.html` into an alpha-onboarding CTA.** Moved the alpha-tester Calendly link out of the profile form onto the confirmation screen, then dropped the "Thank you."/"we'll be in touch" copy in favor of a single focused ask: heading "Fast track getting set up as a test user of Grand", a short explainer, and a primary "Schedule a 20-minute call with us" button (Calendly). Removed the "Back to home" button. **Why:** once someone finishes the profile, booking the onboarding call is the only next step worth surfacing — a confirmation-and-dead-end screen wasted the highest-intent moment.
- **Fixed phone numbers landing in the sheet as `#ERROR!`.** Phone values start with `+` (e.g. `+1 (781) 492-4290`), and Google Sheets parses any cell beginning with `+`, `=`, `-`, or `@` as a formula, so the phone column evaluated to `#ERROR!`. `waitlist.gs` already prefixed the value with a text-forcing apostrophe (`plainTextPhone_`); this adds a second guard, `ensurePhoneColumnIsText_`, which sets the phone column's number format to plain text (`@`) before every write so a raw value can never be parsed as a formula. **Why belt-and-suspenders:** the format guard is independent of the apostrophe and protects any future write path. **Deploy dependency:** this only takes effect once the Apps Script is redeployed (Deploy → Manage deployments → New version) — the error rows in the live sheet were written by the pre-fix deployment. Existing `#ERROR!` cells must be corrected by hand; the original number is still recoverable from that row's `raw_payload` JSON (`"phone":"…"`).

## SEO & Indexing

All URLs are canonicalized to `https://www.grandeldercare.com/` (the `www` host, matching `CNAME`).

- `index.html` `<head>` carries the canonical link, `theme-color`, Open Graph tags, a `twitter:card` tag, and JSON-LD (`Organization` + `WebSite`). Only `twitter:card` is set for X/Twitter — scrapers fall back to the `og:*` tags for title/description/image, so there's one canonical copy of each string instead of hand-synced duplicates.
- The deploy workflow excludes `README.md` and `google-apps-script/` from the published site. **Why:** GitHub Pages was serving the whole repo, so internal strategy notes and the waitlist backend source (including the spreadsheet ID) were live URLs — and robots.txt + the sitemap would have invited crawlers to index them.
- The social share image is `assets/og-image.jpg`, a 1200×630 center crop of the hero photo (the standard large-card size for iMessage, Slack, and social previews).
- `robots.txt` allows all crawlers and points at the sitemap.
- `sitemap.xml` lists the public pages (`/`, `/privacy.html`, `/terms.html`); bump a page's `<lastmod>` when its content changes meaningfully, and add entries as the site grows. `welcome.html` is deliberately excluded because it's `noindex`.
- Favicons: `favicon.svg` is the source of truth (serif "g" on the charcoal `--surface-charcoal` rounded square); `favicon.ico` (32px) is the legacy fallback that crawlers request blindly, and `apple-touch-icon.png` (180px, square-cornered because iOS applies its own mask) covers iOS home-screen bookmarks.
- Google Search Console: the site is verified via the `google-site-verification` meta tag in `index.html` (URL-prefix property for `https://www.grandeldercare.com/`). Don't remove that tag — verification lapses without it. After content changes, the sitemap doesn't need resubmitting; Google re-crawls on its own.

## Ad Pixels

- Meta Pixel is installed in `index.html` and `welcome.html` and tracks the standard `PageView` event on load.
- Reddit Pixel is installed in `index.html` and `welcome.html` with pixel ID `a2_jb07ge9fad9n` and tracks the standard `PageVisit` event on load.
- **Conversion events** fire from `script.js` (not the pixel snippets): a waitlist signup fires `fbq('track','Lead')` + `rdt('track','SignUp')`, and completing the profile page fires `fbq('track','CompleteRegistration')` + `rdt('track','Lead')`. All track calls are guarded, so a blocked or absent pixel never throws.

## PostHog Website Analytics

The site sends privacy-conscious website analytics to the same PostHog Cloud US project as the Grand iOS app, with a strict namespace boundary. `posthog.js` loads the US ingestion endpoint in `cookieless_mode: "always"`, limits person profiles to identified alpha candidates, disables general autocapture, exception capture, feature-flag requests, and session recording, then manually captures pageviews. Web-vitals capture is explicitly enabled and emits PostHog's `$web_vitals` events independently of general autocapture. Every website event carries `platform = "web"` and `analytics_surface = "marketing_website"`; custom events also use a `website_` prefix so they cannot be confused with the iOS taxonomy.

The deliberate website events are `website_cta_clicked`, `website_contact_clicked`, `website_waitlist_started`, `website_waitlist_signup`, `website_waitlist_submission_failed`, `website_profile_completed`, `website_profile_submission_failed`, and `website_onboarding_call_clicked`. Event properties describe only the page/experience, CTA location/label, form type, or fixed failure reason. At a successful waitlist submission the browser generates a random UUID `candidate_id`, stores it only for that browser tab's session, calls PostHog `identify()`, and sends the same ID to the Google Sheet. This makes the candidate's PostHog journey findable from their Sheet row while keeping phone numbers, email addresses, names, ZIP codes, and free-text answers out of PostHog. Earlier anonymous PostHog events from the same session are linked to the identified candidate; the ID deliberately does not persist across a later browser session or another device.

**PostHog project dependency:** in the shared PostHog project's **Project settings → Web analytics**, enable **Cookieless server hash mode** before deploying this integration. Web vitals are enabled explicitly in the JavaScript SDK configuration, so they work while the general autocapture and remote feature-flag requests remain disabled.

## Open Locally

Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step is required.

## Production

Production is served by GitHub Pages at:

https://www.grandeldercare.com/

Because this is a static site with no build step, the `Deploy GitHub Pages` workflow copies `main` to the `gh-pages` branch on every push to `main`. The `CNAME` file keeps the custom domain attached to the Pages deployment.

## Waitlist Backend

The waitlist form posts to a Google Apps Script web app and appends rows to a Google Sheet.
The current configured Sheet is `Grand Waitlist`: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i2_lUmRSIVA1iN3zaE8mLrR-8QEpOUPKtM8Y6aHfw1w/edit

For a fresh setup:

1. Create a Google Sheet for the waitlist.
2. In the sheet, open Extensions -> Apps Script.
3. Paste the contents of `google-apps-script/waitlist.gs`.
4. Optional but recommended: paste the Google Sheet ID into `SPREADSHEET_ID` at the top of the Apps Script file.
5. Deploy as a Web app.
6. Set "Execute as" to yourself and "Who has access" to anyone.
7. Copy the `/exec` web app URL.
8. Paste that URL into `index.html` on the waitlist form's `data-waitlist-endpoint` attribute.

When updating the Apps Script code, use Deploy -> Manage deployments -> Edit -> New version. Saving the code alone does not update the deployed web app. Visiting the `/exec` URL directly should return JSON with `spreadsheet_url`, `waitlist_last_row`, and `event_last_row`; this confirms which spreadsheet the script is writing to.

The client sends the tester's phone number (the Grand site is tagged `product = "grandphone"`, so signups land in the `Grand phone number alpha list` tab — see the product-routing note below), the random non-personal `candidate_id` shared with PostHog, plus source, page URL, referrer, user agent, user-agent client hints where available, language, timezone, viewport, screen, connection hints, a coarse IP-derived `geo` object when the lookup has already completed (city/region/country/postal, best-effort), and other browser metadata. The initial phone capture uses `sendBeacon` with a `keepalive` fetch fallback so the visitor can advance immediately instead of waiting for the Google Apps Script round trip. The request uses a simple `text/plain` POST because Google Apps Script web apps are easiest to call from a static GitHub Pages site without a CORS preflight.

**Privacy note:** the IP geolocation lookup sends the visitor's IP to a third party (`ipapi.co`) and we store their coarse location. If the site gains a privacy policy, it should disclose this. The free `ipapi.co` tier is ~1,000 lookups/day, which is ample at current volume — revisit (or add an API key) if traffic grows.

### Profile fields and the profile page

After queueing the signup, `index.html` stores the phone number in `sessionStorage` under `grand_signup_phone` and redirects to `welcome.html`, a `noindex` page that collects five optional qualifying fields: `full_name`, `email`, `zipcode`, `reason_interested`, and `lives_alone` (yes/no/not_sure). It POSTs a `{ type: "waitlist_profile", product: "grandphone", phone, ... }` payload to the same endpoint. `phone` stays the identity used to match the row; the optional `email`, if given, is written into the row's existing `email` column (only when non-empty, so an empty submission never clears it). The alpha tester question is no longer a yes/no field — instead, the confirmation screen shown after the profile form is submitted (headed "Fast track getting set up as a test user of Grand") invites the tester to book an onboarding call via a primary "Schedule a 20-minute call with us" button linking to Calendly (`https://calendly.com/d/dz47-vkm-rb2/grand-early-tester-program`), so no `alpha_tester` value is collected from the form anymore. The backend still tolerates the field for older submissions.

`handleWaitlistProfile_` in `waitlist.gs` looks up the person's existing row by phone (digits-only match so formatting differences don't matter, most-recent match wins) and **updates that row in place** — one row per person, no duplicates. It matches by phone for phone-based products and by email otherwise. Because the initial signup is queued optimistically, the profile handler briefly retries the lookup before appending a standalone profile row. If the identifier is missing or still unmatched, it appends a standalone profile row so the answers aren't lost. The profile form itself submits fire-and-forget (`sendBeacon` with a keepalive fetch fallback), so the confirmation screen appears instantly instead of blocking on this round trip (the script lock plus the retry loop can take a second or more). This mirrors the initial signup capture; the fallback-row behavior means nothing is lost even if the beacon is dropped.

`ensureHeaders_` now auto-migrates the live sheet: because new columns are only ever appended to the end of `HEADERS` (`geo_*`, then the profile fields, phone, and `candidate_id`), it rewrites the header row in place when the sheet has fewer columns than `HEADERS`, so no manual column setup is needed after deploying a new version.

The same Apps Script endpoint also receives anonymous interaction analytics. For the Grand site these route to the `Grand phone number events` tab (via the `grandphone` product tag); the legacy `Events` tab is the email-era archive. The site records section views, link/button clicks, and waitlist funnel events (`waitlist_phone_focus`, `waitlist_submit_attempt`, `waitlist_submit_success`, `waitlist_submit_error`, and the profile-page equivalents `waitlist_profile_submit_attempt`, `waitlist_profile_submit_success`, `waitlist_profile_submit_error`). These events use a per-browser-tab `session_id` stored in `sessionStorage`; they do not include the tester's phone number.

## Current Sections

Every content section leads with a standardized eyebrow (uppercase, 12px, clay `--status-clay`) above its title. The hero itself has no eyebrow — the headline leads directly. The `.eyebrow` is excluded from the `> p` intro-paragraph rules so it always renders at the base 12px.

- Hero promise ("You'll know she's okay.") with a primary "See how Grand works" CTA and a secondary "Be first to know" waitlist CTA.
- "The worry" problem section: a two-column narrative with the independence/worry copy on the left and an iMessage-style multi-day concern graphic on the right, followed by a compact strikethrough list dismissing pendants/watches, call-for-help buttons, in-home carers, and cameras with one-line stories.
- "How Grand works" section titled as such, with a combined lead ("There's a better way to know they're okay. A small hub and a few sensors. No cameras, nothing to wear, nothing to charge.") and two product cards, each showing a real product photo: `assets/grand-sensor.jpg` (sensor in a wall outlet) and `assets/grand-hub.jpg` (hub on a kitchen counter), both optimized to ~120–210KB JPGs. The `.card-media` slot renders a cover-fit image via `:has(img)`, falling back to a dashed placeholder when no image is present.
- "What Grand pays attention to": everyday activity, the kitchen (meals), and a call for help.
- "Caregiver experience": the daily "she's okay" app view with real iOS app screens, plus a parent-perspective dignity note.
- "The Grand call center" (`#response`): what happens in an emergency — a mirrored two-column section (photo left, copy right) with a four-step numbered process (real person calls through the hub/sensors, confirms she's safe, calls EMS if not, family stays notified and can join the call). Step numerals are bare clay Georgia counters via CSS `counter()`; the photo slot falls back to the standard dashed placeholder if the image is removed.
- Waitlist form with validation and Google Sheets handoff. On success it redirects to the post-signup profile page.
- Post-signup profile page (`welcome.html`, `noindex`): optional full name, ZIP, reason for interest, whether the person Grand is for lives alone, and alpha-tester interest, styled with the shared `styles.css` `.profile-*` rules.
- Site footer: a top row ("Contact us" label + `hello@grandeldercare.com` on the left, nav links — including Privacy Policy and Terms of Service — as a right-aligned single column) above a bottom bar with the `grand.` logo bottom-left and the copyright bottom-right.

## Grace Product Subpage

`/grace` is an independent product-experiment site for the Grace companion — a voice
companion that sits on a parent's kitchen counter. It began as a de-branded duplicate
of the main Grand page and is now the only Grace page (the earlier `/gracecompanion`
and `/gracephone` experiments were removed; see the consolidation note in Status).

- **Independent, no cross-links.** There are deliberately **no navigational links**
  between Grand and `/grace` — the only way to reach it is to type/visit its URL. It
  is also **left out of `sitemap.xml`** so it isn't publicly discoverable via SEO.
- **Self-contained folder (isolation over DRY).** `grace/` has its own `index.html`,
  `welcome.html`, and **own copies** of `styles.css` and `script.js`, so editing it
  can never affect the Grand site. The tradeoff: style changes made to the root site
  must be re-applied here by hand. Shared images use **root-absolute** paths
  (`/assets/...`) so they resolve from the subfolder. GitHub Pages serves `/grace`
  from its in-folder `index.html` automatically; the deploy workflow needs no config.
- **Page structure.** Hero, **The worry** (`#worry`, centered serif + three real
  interview quotes, grounded by `assets/worry-alone.jpg` in a `.worry-lead` two-column
  grid that collapses to one column ≤900px), **What Grace does** (`#what-grace-does`),
  **How Grace works** (`#how-grace-works`), **Grace helps her reach out** (`#reach-out`),
  **Caregiver experience** (`#caregiver`), **What Grace isn't** (`#what-grace-isnt`),
  and the **Early access** waitlist (`#waitlist`). CTA/profiling copy is tester-focused
  ("Become a tester", an early Grace tester note, "ZIP code of your loved one").
- **"What Grace does" is list-formatted.** All three blocks use the `.does-list`
  bold-lead-in style (see the Status note) so the section scans consistently.
- **Post-signup flow.** After a waitlist signup `/grace` redirects to its in-folder
  `welcome.html` profiling page (same five optional fields as Grand, rebranded to Grace).
- **Ad pixels.** The Meta/Reddit pixels reuse Grand's pixel IDs; Grace conversions can
  be split from Grand's by filtering on URL in Ads Manager. The footer links to the
  shared root `/privacy.html` and `/terms.html` (no Grace-specific legal pages).
- **Known a11y note:** the terracotta eyebrow labels (`#b85f4a`) sit at ~3.9:1 on
  cream and ~3.4:1 on the stone band, below WCAG AA 4.5:1; left unchanged pending a
  brand-color decision (body text and dark pill buttons pass).

### Grace waitlist storage (shared endpoint)

`/grace` POSTs to the **same** Apps Script endpoint as the Grand site. Its signups
carry `product = "gracecompanion"` (set in `grace/script.js`, and also on the profile
and analytics payloads plus product-scoped `sessionStorage` keys), so `waitlist.gs`
routes them to the dedicated `GraceCompanion Waitlist`/`GraceCompanion Events` tabs in
the shared spreadsheet — kept as-is after the consolidation for data continuity.

- `PRODUCT_SHEETS` + `sheetNamesForProduct_()` map each product to its own tabs:
  `gracecompanion` → the GraceCompanion tabs, and `grandphone` → the
  `Grand phone number alpha list`/`Grand phone number events` tabs (the Grand site's
  current tag). Payloads with no/unknown `product` still fall through to the legacy
  `Waitlist`/`Events` tabs, which now hold only the historical email-era data.
  (The `gracephone` mapping remains in `waitlist.gs` but is unused.)
- New tabs are auto-created by `getSheet_` + `ensureHeaders_` on first write.

**Deploy step (required for routing to take effect):** after changing `waitlist.gs`,
re-deploy the existing web app via **Deploy → Manage deployments → Edit → New
version** so the endpoint URL stays identical.

## Legal Pages

`privacy.html` and `terms.html` are standalone pages sharing the site header, footer, and stylesheet. They use the `.legal-*` rules in `styles.css`: a centered 760px reading column, an `.legal-header` block (eyebrow, title, "Last updated" line, intro paragraph), and `.legal-body` prose with serif Georgia section headings, `--ink-soft` body text, clay underlined links, and a `.legal-contact` call-out card at the end.

- **Privacy Policy** covers what's collected (waitlist email; optional full-name/ZIP/reason/lives-alone/alpha-tester answers; automatic technical data; cookies/pixels), how it's used and shared, retention, security, children's privacy, and GDPR/CCPA-style choices. Its "Advertising and conversion tracking" section states plainly that **joining the waitlist is treated as a conversion event and shared with advertising partners (Meta, Reddit)** to measure campaigns — the fact the team asked to disclose.
- **Terms of Service** is pre-launch boilerplate: it makes clear the product/service is not yet available and the waitlist is not a purchase or a guarantee, plus eligibility, acceptable use, IP, an explicit "not an emergency/medical service" clause, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and Delaware governing law.
- Unlike `index.html`/`welcome.html`, the legal pages do **not** include the Meta/Reddit pixel snippets. They do include cookieless PostHog pageview analytics so overall site navigation is complete. They are indexable (canonical tags set, listed in `sitemap.xml`).
- Both use the correctly-spelled contact address `hello@grandeldercare.com`. Confirm the governing-law jurisdiction (Delaware placeholder) and have counsel review before relying on these.
